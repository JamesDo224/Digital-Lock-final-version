# ðŸ”’ Password-Based Locking System

This project is a **password-based locking system** commonly used in offices and homes. Instead of relying on physical keys, the system operates with a **4-character password** (digits 0â€“9 and letters Aâ€“F). Enhanced security features are included to deter unauthorized access.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Size
- **4 members**

## ðŸ“Œ Contribution
### ðŸ“‹ Define Requirements
- Identified system design requirements.
- Defined system functions and methods for implementation.
- Expanded and refined development specifications.

### ðŸ›  Implementation
- **Module Implementation**
  - Developed and implemented the **Incorrect Password Handling** and **Password Verification** modules.
- **Extended IO Devices**
  - Configured and integrated the **16x2 LCD display** and **4x4 matrix keypad** for user interaction.
- **Report Writing**
  - Structured and prepared the final **report** for project presentation.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- **Verilog** (for hardware description and system implementation)
- **LaTeX** (for professional report writing)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Enter a **4-character password** (digits 0-9 and letters A-F).
- Verify the entered password and provide feedback on accuracy.
- Increase the waiting time for the next attempt if multiple incorrect passwords are entered, with a buzzer alarm.
- Automatically trigger an **alert** and **close the door** if it remains open for an extended period.
- Provide a manual option to **modify the default password**.
